## My process

Mobile first approach with SASS. I used CSS grid for the desktop display.
I used a html template tag to create a genertic section and then rendered in the data dynamically using the
JSON file provided.

### What I learned

I learned a lot of the intricacies regarding CSS grids. How to manage the size and heights of each grid item.
I also learned to be careful when using queryselectors with dynamically rendered elements. If you perform the
query before they have been rendered you run into trouble

### Continued development

I will persist in my practise with CSS grid until it is fully polished
